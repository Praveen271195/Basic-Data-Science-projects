<h1 align="center">Prediction on Iris dataset with SVM </h1>

## Motivation:
This will contain the notebook with python code for analysing the famous IRIS dataset which is already available in the sklearn library. I have comapred the metrics of 2 cases, where the first case is SVM with default paramenters and the second case is with the altered parameters. Since the dataset is small, much difference cannot be seen in during the evalution. 

## About the dataset:
We will be using the famous Iris flower data set. The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

The iris dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.

The three classes in the Iris dataset:

- Iris-setosa (n=50)
- Iris-versicolor (n=50)
- Iris-virginica (n=50)
- The four features of the Iris dataset:

Sepal length in cm
Sepal width in cm
Petal length in cm
Petal width in cm
